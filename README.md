# Design_Patterns

The project consists of simple design pattern examples of 7 most widely used design patterns:
1. Factory design pattern: This pattern simply means define an interface or an abstract class for creating an object but let the inheriting classes or subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
2. Observer design pattern: Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern which lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the objects they are observing.
3. Adapter design pattern: Adapter design pattern is a design pattern also known as wrapper that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
4. Builder design pattern: Builder design patterns aim is to sepearate construction of an object from its representation so that the same contruction process can create different representations.
5. Singleton design pattern: Singleton design pattern as the name suggests restricts the instantiation of a class to one single object.
6. State design pattern: State design pattern is use to allow subjects to change their behaviour based on the current state.
7. Strategy design pattern: Strategy design pattern is also a kind of behavioural design pattern. This pattern lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into separate class, and make their objects interchangebale.
